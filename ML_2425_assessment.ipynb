    "- Trained classifier predicted the first sample in the test (y_pred for X_test[0]) set as [0] which corressponds to the first encoded class. (BARBUNYA)\n",
    "- Overall accruacy was 63.97% (0.639655) indicating moderate performance of the model.\n",
    "- A good model would be expected achieve 90% + given the deatures in the dataset provide meaningful information and meta data about the classes.\n",
    "- A poor model woud achieve accuracy through random guessing which would be significantly lower than 63.97%\n",

    "##### Chosen Evaluation Strategy\n",
    "- Stratified K-Fold Cross Validation was used as it ensures all samples are used for training and testing. Cross Validation also maintains class proportions in each fold which is important for datasets with imbalanced classes. https://scikit-learn.org/stable/modules/generated/sklearn.model_selection.StratifiedKFold.html\n",
    "- Using multiple splits, in this case 5 splits reduces the variance in evaluation and helps us obtain reliable estimates on the model's generalization performance in comparison to using a single train test split. https://towardsdatascience.com/3-tips-for-working-with-imbalanced-datasets-a765a0f3a0d0\n",
    "##### Chosen Metrics\n",
    "- Accuracy measures the overall correctness or accuracy of the predictions made by the model. This is a standard metric when evaluating a model's performance.\n",
    "- Precision Recall and F1 - Score were chosen as they give more in depth insight on how the model handles each indivual class.\n",
    "    - Precision provides an insight on the relevance of the predictions made.\n",
    "    - Recall measures the ability to retrieve all relevant instances in the class.\n",
    "    - F1-Score is used to balance precision and recall offering a balanced measure of a classifier's performance. It is very useful for imbalanced datasets where FP and FN play a significant role. https://keylabs.ai/blog/understanding-the-f1-score-and-auc-roc-curve/\n",
    "\n",
    "##### Advantages of New Evaluation Strategy\n",
    "- Cross Validation ensures a robust evaluation as it uses all data for training and testing, reducing the biases due to the 5 splits it creates.\n",
    "- The per class metrics provided by my new evaluation strategy provide a deeper insight on how the model performs for each class. This can help identify classes that are poorly handled by the model. After reviewing the evaluation it is evident that our model's performance is poor when it comes to the classes BARBUNYA and SEKER as the f1 scores for these are the lowest across all 5 folds.\n",
    "- The mean and standard diviation of the acurracy across all folds of the evaluation model provides an estimate of the model's stability and consistency as well as over all performance.\n",
    "- This new evaluation strategy highlights insights using Per Class Metrics which can help determine that BOMBAY class shows perfect precision recall and f1-score of 1.00 for all the folds. This helps the arrival at the conclusion that BOMBAY is a rare class and must have unique features such as a high area which isolate it from the rest of the classes."

    "##### **Model Choice**\n",
    "- **Logistic Regression**\n",
    "    - Logistic regression is an interpretable and simple model which excels in multi-class classification problems. This would provide a good baseline model to compare against other more complex models.\n",
    "    - The parameters tested for this model was the regularization strength ('C'). Initially I was going to also test different solvers but the Liblinear solver showed to be the most robust compared to the other solver i was testing 'lgbfs' as that was giving me warnings with the number of iterations.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Support Vector Machine**\n",
    "    - SVM is a powerful and versatile model that handles linear and non-linear classification problems, It is particularily effective in handling high dimensional data, in the context of the beans dataset , there are multiple numerical features which the SVM can effectively utilize to find an optimal hyperplane that seperates the classes. https://www.ibm.com/think/topics/support-vector-machine\n",
    "    - The parameters tested for this model were the regularization strength ('C') and the kernel type(linear and rbf). The linear kernel was chosen due to its simplicity and effectiveness in producing a higher accuracy.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Decision Tree**\n",
    "    - Decision Tree's are simple yet powerful models that can handle classification and regression tasks. They are easy to visualize making them easy to interpret and understand the decision making process. These trees can be used to determine feature importance, helping determine what the most influential features are when classifying beans.\n",
    "    - Parameters tested for this model were the maximum depth of the tree (max depth) and the criterion for splitting (gini and entropy). The gini was chosen for producing better results.\n",
    "\n",
    "##### **HyperParameter Tuning**\n",
    "- Accuracy was chosen as the metric used for evaluating the parameters of each model as it is easy to interpret and straightforward. \n",
    "- A function was created **find_best_params(model, params, X, y):** , This took in the model along with its parameters to be tested, a grid search was run on the models using cross validation with 5 folds using accuracy as the scoring. **grid_search.best_estimator_** was then used to assign the model that resulted in the best scoring (accuracy) to the variable **best_params_model**. \n",
    "- **{model.__class__.__name__}: {grid_search.best_params_}** was then used to output the best parameters for that model and **{model.__class__.__name__}: {grid_search.best_score_}** was used to output the accuracy these parameters achieved.\n",
    "- The function returned **best_params_model** which was the most accurate model from the parameters provided.\n",
    "- This function was then called model 1, 2 and 3 with their respective defintion and parameters.\n",

    "- **Logistic Regression**\n",
    "    - Logistic Regression may not capture complex relationships in the data as effectively as more complex data, it is more so used as a base line to compare to more complext models as mentioned.\n",
    "    - Using a different solver and higher number of maximum Iterations if higher computation power can be accessed could help improve convergence.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Support Vector Machine** https://alekhyo.medium.com/computational-complexity-of-svm-4d3cacf2f952\n",
    "    - SVM is computationally expensive when it comes to large datasets and non-linear kernels. This caused the hyperparameter tuning of the SVM model to be significantly slower than the other models.\n",
    "    - Optimizing kernel paramters can improve performance and run time of computing best parameters, additionally using a scaling method or feature selection can enhance effectiveness.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Decision Tree**\n",
    "    - With deep trees, decision trees can be prone to overfitting, capturing noise and outliers rather than the underlying pattern. The beans dataset contains 2900 samples and 16 Numerical Features, this makes the risk of overfitting prevelant and can lead to poor generalization.\n",
    "    - Pruning the decision tree can prevent it from becoming too complex and avoid overfitting the training data. Subsequently creating a more balanced and generalizable model. \n",

    "##### **Conclusion**\n",
    "- The SVM Model with C = 0.1 and kernel = 'linear' was the best performing model, with a mean accuracy of 0.9138. It showedstrong and consistent performance across different folds and classes.\n",
    "- To better select a best model, using Per Class Metrics to determine what parameters to use could enhance which the parameters selected especially for an imbalanced dataset. F1-Score is used to balance out precision and recall and so finding the mean F1-score for each Model and using it in combination with the accuracy of the model to find the best parameters could enhance the performance of the models"

    "\n",
    "#### Choice of Bagging Parameters\n",
    "- for the number of bagged models I choise 10 (n_estimators = 10) to balance out computational efficiency and performance improvement, when trying to use higher n_estimators I realized the computation started taking very long and it could result in deminishing accuracy despite reducing variance further.\n",
    "- for the random_state I decided to keep it consistent throughout my entire program for reproducability, using random_state = 42.\n",
    "- The base model parameters were kept to the same optimized parameters previously used to ensure consistency when comparing metrics. https://scikit-learn.org/1.5/modules/generated/sklearn.ensemble.BaggingClassifier.html\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Effects of Voting Ensemble\n",
    "- **Voting Ensemble on Base Models (eclf)** The eclf outperformed the individual models in terms of Accuracy by leveraging the strengths of each model by considering thier collective predictions. Resulting in a more robust decision boundary. https://soulpageit.com/ai-glossary/ensemble-voting-explained/\n",
    "- **Voting Ensemble on Bagged Models (ebclf)** The ebclf performed better than the eclf due to the added stability and reduced variance of the bagged models. https://www.datacamp.com/tutorial/what-bagging-in-machine-learning-a-guide-with-examples This improvement was most notable for Decision tree component of the ensemble of bagged models (ebclf) as mentioned before Decision tree usually overfits due to high variance but is more stable with the reduced variance from bagging.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Final Comparisons and Conclusion\n",
    "- **Individual Base Models**\n",
    "    Showed varying performance with Decision Tree being the most sensitive to overfitting and high variance.\n",
    "- **Bagged Base Models**\n",
    "    Provided better generalization and stability of Per Class Metrics, particularily benefiting Decision Tree.\n",
    "- **Voting Ensembles**\n",
    "    -eclf Showed improved performance compared to the individual base models by combining the strengths of each one.\n",
    "    -ebclf Outperformed all models by utilizing the strengths of the bagged models, particularily utilizing the low variance Bagged Decision Tree.\n",
    "\n",
    "    **Conclusion**\n",
    "- Bagging reduced variance and improved generlization of the individual models.\n",
    "- The Voting Ensemble of Bagged Models (ebclf) was the best-performing approach, combining the strengths of diversity through bagging and aggregation through voting. This highlights the importance of ensemble methods when improving model performance"

This confusion matrix indicates that our model has a low number of misclassifications confirming the strong performance it has. As can be seen in the matrix, 21 out of 21 samples were correctly classified for the class BOMBAY, the least precise classification was SIRA as that has proved to be a challenging class to classify throughout this project, this was still 87 / 109 samples or otherwise interpreted as 80%. Overall the confusion matrix shows that the model has  ahigh number of true positives and a low number opf false positives and false negatives with an Overall Accuracy of 0.9293\n",

    "The Voting Ensemble Bagged of Bagged Models achieved a mean accuracy of 0.9252 and a standard deviation of 0.0132 during cross-validation. This indicates accuracy and consistency in predictions. It combines the strengths of bagging and voting ensemble techniques, leading to a robust and generalizable model. The classification report shows that the model performed well across most classes with high precision and recall values. Further confirming its strong performance and low nuymber of misclassifcations.\n",
    "The classfication report and accuracy of the confusion matrix show lower performance metrics compared to the cross validation evaluation results from the evaluate_model function. This could be due to the speceific split of the confusion matrix not utilizing multiple train test splits and only a single split. \n",
    "Overall this model proves to be the most robust out of the ones explored in this project for classification of beans."
